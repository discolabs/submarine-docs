# Admin API

The Admin API can be used to further extend the Submarine platform and implement custom business logic that isn't achievable through configuration, the Customer API, or the Shopify Flow integration.

Examples would include programatically swapping out products across all currently active subscriptions, pulling in upcoming subscription orders to calculate required production capacity, or fetching a list of a customer's stored payment methods to let them pay instantly in person at a retail location.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Submarine Admin API is in a Beta phase and documentation is not currently publicly available. Please contact Disco Labs if you have an integration need with the Admin API that you'd like to explore.
