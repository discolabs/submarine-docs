# Setup and Configuration

This page walks through the steps that will be undertaken to set up and configure Submarine on a Shopify store. All new Submarine installations are currently managed by Disco Labs, so they'll be able to provide support and guidance during this process.

## Installation

### Shopify applications

Disco Labs will request collaborator access to each Shopify store Submarine is to be used on \(both staging and production\).

Once granted, the Submarine, Shopify Script Editor and Shopify Flow applications will be installed on each store \(if not already installed\).

### Payment gateway

The Submarine Payment Gateway will be installed on each store.

{% hint style="info" %}
Payment Gateways must be installed and configured by the owner of the Shopify store. Disco Labs will provide the owner with the URL to begin the installation process and the requisite configuration values.
{% endhint %}

### Checkout customisation

If not already enabled, checkout customisations will be enabled on each store \(this requires a request to the merchant's Shopify Plus account manager\).

## Configuration

### Payment processors

Disco Labs will configure API credentials for the merchant's selected payment processors within Submarine.

### Payment gateway script

The merchant's active Payment Gateway Shopify Script will be updated to include logic to show or hide the Submarine payment gateway based on the type of order going through the Shopify checkout.
