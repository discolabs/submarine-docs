# Security and Compliance

## Is Submarine PCI compliant?

**Yes.**

Customer payment information never passes directly to Submarine. All sensitive payment details are sent directly from the Shopify Plus Checkout to the merchants' payment processor, after which a tokenised version of the payment method is created and passed back to Submarine.

## Does Submarine back up data?

**Yes \(securely\).**

All Submarine data is periodically backed up off-site \(using Tarsnap, a highly secure encrypted backup service used by many companies handling sensitive information including Stripe\).

Tarsnap ensures that data is fully encrypted on our servers before transmission.

## What's Submarine's Disaster Recovery Plan?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
