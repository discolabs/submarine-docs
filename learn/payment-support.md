# Payment Methods

While Submarine provides its own payment gateway for integration with the Shopify checkout, the tokenisation and processing of payments is handled by one of Submarine's supported payment processors, which is configured for each merchant.

This page lists the current state of integration for a range of major payment processors and the payment methods they offer. If your payment processor isn't on this list, please [contact Disco Labs](mailto:hello@discolabs.com?subject=Adding%20support%20for%20a%20new%20Submarine%20payment%20method) to explore adding support.
